# RWT-GCN
Random Walk based Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Dynamic Graphs

# Notes
1. Origin graph file names must be timestamp format or integer number format
2. Unweighted random walk are set as default in the 'get_tensor' function of 'RWTGCN/preprocessing/tensor_generation.py' file. But weighted random walk are also supported.
